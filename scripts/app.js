// * When I load the page I should know what I'm playing

/* Have a "start game" button 
    - clicking "start game" will tell the computer to get its colour combanation
    - The "start game" button will 'hide'
    - The "submit" button will appear
    - The player will be able to select colours

/* The computer will select a colour combanation of 4 colours from a 6 colour range
    - The colours will be selected using an array and I will use math.random for the randomization

/* I can select from an option of 6 colours from the colour panel to input
    - A button will be used for the selection
*/

/* Once a colour is picked I can choose to make 1 of 4 squares(holes) the selected colour
    - This will respond only after a colour has been chosen from the colour panel 
    - I can do this through selecting the square(hole) in the form of a button
*/

/* Once all 4 squares(holes) have been filled with a colour I can submit my guess
    - I will store the selected colours in an array and compare it to the computers chosen to determine the result
    - The 'submit' button can only be pressed once all 4 squares(holes) have been filled with a colour
*/

/* Afetr sumbmitting, depending on the player choice of colours, they will see a white or black peg
    - From the result comparison I will display no pegs, or white or blakc pegs
    - White: One or more colours match the computers choice
    - Black: one or more colours match the compiters choice and the position


/* Then repeat the process (max of 10 guesses) on the next row until you guess the colour combination or loose
    - If guessed correctly display a "you win" screen with audio, and a promt to play again
    - If guessed incorretly, afetr all 10 guesses, display a "you loose" screen with audio and the computers chosen colour combanation, and a promt to play again
    - if "play again" is pressed the computer will begin the randomization process and the game will start again
